    # if TimeTaken is in range(x1, y1) assign the row the label "Short"
    # if TimeTaken is in range(x2, y2) assign the row the label "Medium"
    # if TimeTaken is in range(x3, y3) assign the row the label "Long"

    # split the data into these 3 classes, creating 3 csv's

# 3.
    # delete the class labels (to avoid correlation/collinearity with TimeTaken)

# 4.
    # train 3 regression models, one for each class

# 5.
    # create model to classify unseen data into these 3 classes
